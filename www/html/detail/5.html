                The income statement presents the results of the entity's operations during a period of time, such as one year. The simplest equation to describe income is:





                </p>

            <p class="page-item">
                Net Income  =  Revenue  -  Expenses
            </p>

            <p class="page-item">
                Revenue refers to inflows from the delivery or manufacture of a product or from the rendering of a service. Expenses are outflows incurred to produce revenue.

            </p>

            <p class="page-item">
                Income from operations can be separated from other forms of income. In this case, the income can be described by:

            </p>

            <p class="page-item">
                Net Income  =  Revenue  -  Expenses  +  Gains  -  Losses

            </p>

            <p class="page-item">
                where gains refer to items such as capital gains, and losses refer to capital losses, losses from natural disasters, etc.

            </p>
