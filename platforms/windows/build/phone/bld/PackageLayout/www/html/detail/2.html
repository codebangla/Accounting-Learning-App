                <b>Definition:</b> The basic accounting formula forms the logical basis for double entry accounting.<br/>
                Basic Equation:<br/>

                <b>Assets = Liabilities + Owners' Equity</b><br/>

                The three components of the basic accounting formula are:<br/>

                <b>Assets:</b> These are the tangible and intangible assets of a business, such as cash, accounts receivable, inventory, and fixed assets.<br/>
                <b>Liabilities:</b> These are the obligations of a business to pay its creditors, such as for accounts payable, accrued wages, and loans.<br/>
                <b>Shareholders' equity:</b> This is funds obtained from investors, as well as accumulated profits that have not been distributed to investors.

                    Expanded Equation:<br/>
                    <b>
                        Assets = Liabilities  + Owners' Capital - Owners’ Drawings + Revenues - Expenses

                    </b>
                <br/>
               <b>Revenues:</b>   Revenues are the gross increase in owner’s equity resulting from
                business activities entered into for the purpose of earning income. Generally,
                revenues result from selling merchandise, performing services, renting property.<br/>
                <b>Drawings:</b>  An owner may withdraw cash or other assets for personal use. We
                use a separate classifi cation called drawings to determine the total withdrawals
                for each accounting period. Drawings decrease owner’s equity. They are recorded
                in a category called owner’s drawings. <br/>
                <b>Expenses:</b>  Expenses are the cost of assets consumed or services used in the pro-
                cess of earning revenue. They are decreases in owner’s equity that result from
                operating the business
